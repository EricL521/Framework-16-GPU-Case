# Framework-16-GPU-Case
A model of a case for the Framework 16 GPU or Expansion Bay Shell when detached from device

## Important Notes
- Side Insert parts were printed using TPU
- Everything else was printed using PLA
- This is nowhere close to perfect
- I have now adjusted the models, however, in my latest print, I had to carve some material away to get it to fit
  - So, it probably works, but might have to make some small changes
- Original Onshape model can be found at ```https://cad.onshape.com/documents/ea207ebf9da837a25953a6d7/w/df85aff099559bf0ee27aa39/e/67aca5cd3b43a4552ce52b77```
