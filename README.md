# Framework-16-GPU-Case
A model of a case for the Framework 16 GPU when detached from device

## Important Notes
- Side Insert parts were printed using TPU
- Everything else was printed using PLA
- I have since adjusted the models, however, in my latest print, I had to carve some material away to get it to fit
  - So, might not work, but probably does
